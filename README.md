Sample project Source Tree crash
================================

SourceTree becomes very slow, hangs or crashs when commits contains many changes. The application becomes irresponsive 
It cannot display the last commit. It hangs undefinitely.
On other projects with more changes, there's a message about memory usage becoming too high and eventually SourceTree crashes. I can add more commits if you want to reproduce the crash.

Here's a overview of the committed changes (in Visual Studio code)
